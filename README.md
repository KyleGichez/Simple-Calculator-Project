### What I learned

I have learned how to build an E-commerce website using bootstrap 5 components such as cards, list-groups, badges, accordions, modals etc.

```Bootstrap
.bg-primary - bootstrap utility class for blue background
.d-none .d-sm-block - bootstrap utility class for hiding information on extra small screen sizes only.
```

### Continued development

I am still learning how to use the bootsrap 5 components and also implementing intuitive designs for the website layouts.
I am also learning how to use material design / Material UI for creating intuitive designs and also jQuery for enhancing website interactivity.
